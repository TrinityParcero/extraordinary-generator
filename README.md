# Extraordinary Generator of Things

## Summary

This is something I've been working on on-and-off since college, started as a very basic name generator for a homework assignment. I mainly wanted to make my own name generator as someone who makes a lot of characters for TTRPGs and other projects, and was disappointed with the ones I found online being either entirely common boring names like "John Waters" and "Stacy Adams" or Full-On Fantasy stuff like "Riluaneth Wysaxidor" or "Morluk Battlespell". Being very into classic D&D media, I saw Gary Gygax's Extraordinary Book of Names as a good place to start for getting a variety of names. After finishing the first pass at the Extraordinary Generator of Names, I decided I may as well keep going and make some other random generator tools I often find myself wishing I had on hand while playing or DMing.

## Name Sources

## Summary / Status of Each Tool

### Names

Random name generator taking the bulk of its content from The Extraordinary Book of Names by Gary Gygax. Allows filtering by name origin/culture, and gender.

Status

-   Functioning!

Known Issues / Planned Improvements

-   Source material is pretty biased towards European cultures - names from African, Asian, and Native American cultures are fewer and (at least in some cases) less authentic. Name lists for those cultures should be double checked against more reliable sources and augmented / edited. On the same note - I feel that having a "Miscellaneous" section feels somewhat dismissive towards the cultures listed therein - would like to get more related name sources so they can be split into more descriptive categories instead of being lumped together.
-   Categorization of names is a little funky due to the aforementioned Europe-heavyness of the data.

### Characters

Random character generator that lets you tailor result by race, class, etc.

-   Functioning!

Known Issues / Planned Improvements

-   Maybe make subclasses and subraces optional?
-   Maybe change default selections to be only PHB options? Or make a "Only give me basic PHB stuff" button
-   Select all buttons for race, class and background don't work
-   Recategorize names - English, European and East European as separate categories doesnt make much sense
-   Add some nice css animations to collapsibles and generation?

### Trinkets

Random trinket generator that lets you filter by which sourcebooks trinkets are pulled from.

-   Functioning!

Known Issues / Planned Improvements


### Loot

-   On deck for implementation
